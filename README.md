   </ul>

### 3. [Custom 2D Game Engine (Thermo)](https://github.com/Aletropy/thermo)
   <p>My ongoing personal project to develop a proprietary 2D graphics engine. This endeavor allows me to explore the intricacies of graphics programming, performance optimization, and engine architecture.</p>
   <ul>
     <li>🎨 Explores low-level graphics APIs and rendering techniques.</li>
     <li>🏗️ Focuses on building a modular and extensible engine core.</li>
     <li>⚙️ <strong>Technologies:</strong> C++, OpenGL</li>
   </ul>

### 4. Minecraft Mod Development (Forge & Fabric)
   <p>Developed some mods for Minecraft (Java Edition) using both Forge and Fabric modding frameworks. These projects involved Kotlin programming, API interaction, and creative problem-solving to extend game functionality.</p>
   <ul>
     <li>🧩 Demonstrates proficiency in Kotlin/Java and experience with modding ecosystems.</li>
     <li>💡 Check my only mod posted on modrinth (Not longer updated for time reasons) <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/just-tombstone">Just Tombsone</a></li>
